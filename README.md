👋 Hi, I’m Prem! I was previously a Financial Data Analyst. Currently, I am transitioning careers and looking for Data Scientist roles. <br><br>
👀 I’m interested in biomedical research, specifically in the realm of Neuroscience. However, my primary interest lies in data and how to best extract insights from it to help any person or organization.<br><br>
🌱 What I'm working on right now (August '24): 
1. Learning Django
2. Sushi Nutrition Analytics
<br><br>
💡 I tutor/teach several courses in my part-time. Currently, I am teaching K-12 math to kids, college Calculus, Micro/Macroeconomics, and Statistics.
⏱️ In the future, I want to write Medium articles to effectively communicate work from completed projects and share personal perspectives and anecdotes on my various other interests, from sports to ADHD.<br><br>
