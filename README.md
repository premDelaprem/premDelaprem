👋 Hi, I’m Prem! I was previously a Financial Data Analyst. Currently, I am transitioning careers and looking for Data Scientist roles. <br><br>
👀 I’m interested in biomedical research, specifically in the realm of Neuroscience. However, I am open to work in any industry/field. <br><br>
🌱 I’m currently building my own website, studying AI & ML, searching for new and challenging projects to tackle, and tutoring STEM & Executive Functioning skills part-time. <br><br>
⏱️ In the future, I want to write Medium articles to effectively communicate Data Science concepts from my completed projects. <br><br>
