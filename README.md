ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prem! I am a Data Scientist by day and Educator by night. I have previously taught as an Adjunct Professor in Economics at Cypress College and worked as a Data Analyst at Epic Systems.

Currently, I work at FEMA and wear multiple hats - both as a data analyst and as an engineer. I assist my team in extracting data from hard-to-get places, build dashboards, and write custom Python programs to assist our day-to-day operations and automate tasks. I also teach math to K-12 students in my part-time, and provide freelance tutoring to high school & college students in Economics, Statistics, and Calculus courses. <br><br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in biomedical research and applying data science techniques to advance healthcare, specifically in the realm of Neuroscience.<br><br>

ðŸŒ± What I'm working on right now (August '24): 
1. Building a Django web app for my favorite card game, [Estimation](https://blog.jawaker.com/en/estimation-rules-en/)
2. Sushi Nutrition Analytics
<br><br>

ðŸ’¡ I tutor/teach several courses in my part-time. Currently, I am teaching K-12 math, including Algebra 2, AP Calculus, AP Micro/Macroeconomics, and AP Statistics.
