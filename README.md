👋 Hi, I’m Prem! I am a Data Scientist by day and Educator by night. I have previously taught as an Adjunct Professor in Economics at the Community College level and worked as a Financial Data Analyst. <br>

Currently, I am working on passion projects, teaching math to K-12 students, and freelance tutoring college Economics, Statistics, and Calculus courses. <br><br>

👀 I’m interested in biomedical research, specifically in the realm of Neuroscience. However, my primary interest lies in data and how to best extract insights from it to help any person or organization.<br><br>

🌱 What I'm working on right now (August '24): 
1. Learning Django
2. Sushi Nutrition Analytics
<br><br>

💡 I tutor/teach several courses in my part-time. Currently, I am teaching K-12 math to kids, college Calculus, Micro/Macroeconomics, and Statistics.

⏱️ I enjoy writing Medium articles to effectively communicate work from completed projects and share personal perspectives and anecdotes on my various other interests, from sports to ADHD. [Medium posts coming soon](https://medium.com/@patelprem922)<br><br>
