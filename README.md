👋 Hi, I’m Prem! I am a Data Generalist by day and Educator by night. I have previously taught as an Adjunct Professor in Economics at Cypress College and worked as a Data Analyst at Epic Systems.

Currently, I work at FEMA and wear multiple hats - both as a data analyst/scientist and as an engineer. I assist my team in extracting data from hard-to-get places, build dashboards, work on risk evaluation models, and write custom Python programs to assist our day-to-day operations and automate tasks. I also teach math to K-12 students in my part-time, and provide freelance tutoring to high school & college students in Economics, Statistics, and Calculus courses. <br><br>

👀 I’m interested in applying data science techniques to advance any field I find myself working. What I love about data science as a discipline is that I'm always learning, both about techniques to perform data science work and about the industry I work in.<br><br>

💡 I tutor/teach several courses in my part-time. Currently, I am teaching K-12 math, including Algebra 2, AP Calculus, AP Micro/Macroeconomics, and AP Statistics.
